# PROJ_2_SERIES-VS-PARALLEL

Project TItle: Series vs Parallel Circuit

Objectuive: Create a program that can differentiate the type of electrical circuit based on user's input and response through questionnaires.

Description:

This project aims to create an interactive tool for identifying electrical circuit types. The program asks users a series of questions about their circuit's configuration and behavior, validating their responses to ensure accuracy. Based on user input, the tool determines whether the circuit is a series circuit, a parallel circuit, or undetermined, providing users with clear feedback and educational value. By guiding users through this identification process, the project enhances their understanding of basic circuit types and their characteristics.

Features:

Interactive Interface: Engages users with clear and concise questions about their circuit's configuration and behavior.

Input Validation: Ensures users provide valid inputs (1 or 2) through the get_user_choice function, handling invalid inputs gracefully.

Circuit Identification: Analyzes responses to identify if the circuit is a series circuit, a parallel circuit, or undetermined.

Modular Design: Uses functions like get_user_choice to keep the code organized, reusable, and maintainable.

Educational Value: Helps users understand the characteristics of series and parallel circuits through the identification process.

User Feedback: Summarizes the identified circuit type and thanks users for participating.

Extensibility: Allows for easy addition of more questions or features to further refine the identification process and adapt the program for future improvements.
